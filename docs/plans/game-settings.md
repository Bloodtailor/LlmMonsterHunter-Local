# Game Settings — In-Game Settings Panel + DeepSeek Provider — Plan

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED (July 2026) — all four milestones landed. Pending
Aaron's live soak (real key): the verification checklist below.
**Branch:** `feature/game-settings` — one milestone commit per milestone, prefix `Set-M#`.

Today the game speaks to exactly one text engine: the local
llama-cpp-python model, configured entirely by `.env` and loaded at
startup — changing anything means editing `.env` and restarting. This
initiative adds an in-game **settings panel** (v1 scope: LLM setup
only, built as a sectioned overlay so future sections slot in) and a
second text-generation provider: the **DeepSeek API**
(OpenAI-compatible, `https://api.deepseek.com`). The player pastes an
API key, fetches the live model list, picks or types a model, and
flips an explicit Local / DeepSeek switch — no restart. Observability
grows with it: the streaming panel names the model that is generating,
and the debug logs record model name + prompt token count for every
generation.

Timing note that shaped the design: DeepSeek's current models are
`deepseek-v4-flash` / `deepseek-v4-pro` (1M context); `deepseek-chat` /
`deepseek-reasoner` deprecate 2026-07-24. A hardcoded model list would
be stale in weeks — hence live discovery.

## Locked decisions (design review with Aaron, July 2026)

1. **v1 scope: LLM setup only.** The panel is a general sectioned
   surface; one section ships ("Text Generation"). Image-gen and
   gameplay knobs are future sections, not v1.
2. **Manual provider switch.** Explicit Local / DeepSeek selector; no
   silent auto-fallback on errors — failures surface through the
   existing `llm.generation.failed` path. Local is the default when
   nothing is configured.
3. **Access everywhere via the header.** A gear button in the
   persistent `App.js` header opens a fixed-position overlay (the
   `StreamingDisplay` / `DungeonContextPanel` pattern, which already
   live in that header). An overlay — not a nav screen — because a
   screen switch would unmount the live game screen mid-dungeon, and
   the header works on the title screen and Developer view alike.
4. **Settings survive New Game.** New `game_settings` table;
   `wipe_world()` deletes an explicit model list, so the table
   survives by omission — asserted by a test (the log-tables
   precedent).
5. **Live model discovery + manual fallback.** Model list fetched from
   DeepSeek `GET /models` (auto up-to-date; returns ids only). Context
   window auto-fills from a small built-in known-models map and is
   ALWAYS editable; free-text model entry works when the fetch fails
   or a model is brand-new.
6. **Provider stamped at request time.** The gateway resolves settings
   per request and stamps provider + model onto the log/queue item —
   queued generations finish on the provider they were requested
   under, and prompt logging stays byte-exact for both providers (the
   nothink prefill applies to local only; DeepSeek gets
   `thinking: {type: 'disabled'}` instead).
7. **DeepSeek runs non-thinking mode in v1.** Params translated:
   max_tokens / temperature / top_p / frequency_penalty /
   presence_penalty / stop pass through; llama-only knobs (top_k,
   repeat_penalty, mirostat family, tfs_z, typical_p, seed, echo) are
   dropped. `reasoning_content` deltas are skipped defensively.
   `stream_options: {include_usage: true}` supplies exact prompt /
   completion token counts in the final chunk.
8. **API key at rest:** plaintext JSON in the local MySQL row
   (single-player local game — documented risk), and NEVER returned by
   the API: reads carry `has_api_key` + last-4 only; a save with a
   blank key field keeps the stored key.
9. **Tests keep stubbing at the game layer**
   (`game/utils/prompt_helpers.py::build_and_generate`). The provider
   seam sits below it, so every existing offline suite passes
   unchanged; the DeepSeek suite monkeypatches `requests` — no network
   in tests.
10. **Out of scope (v1):** per-provider inference-param editing in the
    UI, auto-unload of the local model when switching away (it stays
    in VRAM; the ComfyUI path already unloads it when it needs the
    GPU), thinking mode, other OpenAI-compatible hosts (the seam makes
    them cheap later), editing local model path/context from the panel
    (read-only display; `.env` + restart remains the way).

## Milestones

### M1 — Settings storage + API — IMPLEMENTED
No generation behavior change. `models/game_setting.py` (key/JSON
value, GlobalVariable-style, wipe-exempt by omission);
`ai/llm/provider_settings.py` (`resolve_llm_settings()` merges the DB
row over env with local/env as the unbreakable floor — missing
row/table/app-context can never break generation; read per request, no
cache); `services/settings_service.py` (validation trust boundary, key
masking); `routes/settings_routes.py`: GET `/api/settings/llm`
(provider, local status block, masked deepseek block, known-models
map), PUT `/api/settings/llm` (provider enum, positive context window,
deepseek requires key stored-or-provided + model). Registered in
`app.py`; imported in `models/core.py::create_tables`.
Suite: `test_game_settings.py` (get/set, precedence, masking,
validation, wipe survival). Docs: `docs/api/settings.md` + README index.

### M2 — Provider seam + observability — IMPLEMENTED
`ai/llm/providers/` package: `__init__.py::get_provider()`, `local.py`
(thin adapter over `inference.generate_streaming`; adds `model_name` =
model filename and exact `prompt_tokens` via `model.tokenize()`).
Dispatch in `processor.py` by the stamped provider. `llm_logs` gains
`provider` + `prompt_tokens` (nullable) — `create_from_params` stamps
provider/model at creation, `mark_response_completed` records prompt
tokens; one-off dev-DB script `tests/add_provider_log_columns.py`
(affinity-column precedent) + two `_SCHEMA_MARKERS` in `harness.py`.
`QueueItem.model_name` captured in `add_request` (caller's context)
rides `item.to_dict()` into `llm.generation.started` — additive only,
no event renames. Frontend: transformers pass `modelName` /
`promptTokens` / `provider` through; `aiStateStore.llmStatus` keeps
`modelName`; `StreamingDisplay` titles the LLM section with the model;
`LlmLogDetails` shows Provider + Prompt Tokens. Docs:
`docs/api/data-models.md`.

### M3 — DeepSeek provider — IMPLEMENTED
`ai/llm/providers/deepseek.py`: `generate_streaming` (streaming chat
completion via `requests` — no new dependency; single user message;
param translation per locked decision 7; skips `reasoning_content`;
captures the usage chunk for exact token counts; maps 401 invalid key /
402 balance / 429 rate limit / 5xx to clear errors), `list_models`,
`KNOWN_MODELS` context-window map. Resolver gains deepseek resolution
(stored context window, known-map fallback);
`game/utils/context_limits.py::get_context_size_tokens()` asks the
resolver first; `startup.py` skips the local model load when the saved
provider is DeepSeek (switching back mid-session works — inference
self-loads). Routes: POST `/api/settings/llm/fetch-models` (proxies
with provided-or-stored key — doubles as key validation), POST
`/api/settings/llm/test` (tiny generation through the normal gateway so
it shows in the streaming panel and logs).
Suite: `test_deepseek_provider.py` (monkeypatched requests). Docs:
`docs/api/settings.md`, `docs/tuning.md` (in-game settings section).

### M4 — Settings panel UI — IMPLEMENTED
`components/settings/`: `SettingsOverlay.js` (gear-opened, sectioned),
`LlmSettingsSection.js`, `settings.css`; `api/services/settings.js` +
`api/transformers/settings.js` (+ jest). Gear `IconButton` in the
`App.js` header. UX: provider radio → Local card (read-only: model
file, loaded badge, context size, "configured in .env") | DeepSeek card
(masked key input showing last-4; Fetch models → live Select, success
proves the key; select-or-type toggle; context window auto-fills from
the known map, always editable, unknown-model + cost hints). Save
(PUT, disabled until valid) and Test generation (post-save, response
shown, model name visible in the streaming panel). Docs:
`docs/architecture.md` provider-seam note; this plan → IMPLEMENTED.

## Verification

Offline suites (LLM stubbed / HTTP monkeypatched, test DB):
`test_game_settings`, `test_deepseek_provider`; full pytest (existing
suites stay green — the seam is below `build_and_generate`). Static:
ruff, file-size ceiling, prettier, jest. Live soak (Aaron, real key):
open settings from the title screen AND mid-dungeon → paste key →
fetch models → pick `deepseek-v4-flash` (context auto-fills; edit
down) → save → test generation → dungeon scene + battle on DeepSeek →
Developer log rows show model name + prompt tokens → switch back to
Local without restart → New Game → settings survive → break the key on
purpose → 401 surfaces clearly, no silent fallback.

## Deviations

- **M3 (thinking param):** `thinking: {type: 'disabled'}` is NOT sent to
  the legacy `deepseek-reasoner` id — that id IS thinking mode by
  definition (an alias of v4-flash thinking until 2026-07-24), and
  disabling would contradict the player's pick. `reasoning_content`
  deltas are skipped either way, so game text stays clean.
- **M4 (soak fix):** the test-generation endpoint read `prompt_tokens`
  as None — the queue worker writes token counts in its own session
  while the request's MySQL REPEATABLE READ snapshot is already open.
  The service now rolls the snapshot back before reading the log.
  Found live in the browser soak; the panel then reported the real
  count (33 prompt tokens).
