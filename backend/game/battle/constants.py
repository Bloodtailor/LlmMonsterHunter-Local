# Battle Constants - The Condition Ladder and Impact System
# No HP math anywhere: monster wellbeing is a position on a fixed ladder,

# Monster wellbeing, best to worst. Bottom of the ladder = out of the fight.

# ===== RESOURCE POOLS (stamina and mana) =====
# Same philosophy as the condition ladder: no numbers, just positions on
# a word ladder. The referee picks a cost word per action; Python steps
# the ladder. Pools refill ONLY when the party enters the dungeon (plus
# whatever the referee grants: camp rest, defend stances, restoring
# abilities and items).

# Reserve levels, fullest to emptiest. Bottom = nothing left to give.

# ===== ABILITY SCHEMA V2 (numbers at birth - numeric-core initiative) =====

# the multipliers; until then the words ride along as referee context.
