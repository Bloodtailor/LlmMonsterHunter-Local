# Context Limits - Token-Aware Budgets for LLM Prompt Blocks
# Budgets scale with the ACTIVE provider's context window - the settings
# resolver answers (DeepSeek: the per-model window saved in the panel;
# local: LLM_CONTEXT_SIZE in .env, the same key core.py loads with):
# a 4096-token model gets lean prompts, an 8192-token model gets richer
# ones, a 1M-token model is effectively unclamped.
#
# Two kinds of blocks:
#   REQUIRED  - identity data the LLM must have whole (party and monster
#               details). NEVER truncated.
#   FLEXIBLE  - growing history (logs, dialogue). Each gets a percentage
#               share of the prompt budget and is truncated to fit,
#               keeping the most recent content.
